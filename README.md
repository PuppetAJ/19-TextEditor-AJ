# Module 19 Text Editor challenge


![](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-green)


## Description

This is Adrian Jimenez's module 19 text editor challenge submission. 

This project is a simple text editing application that can persistently store text, whether the user is online or offline. In addition, this app uses indexedDB to store data on the client side, and webpack to bundle the necessary assets together. By using webpack and a variety of webpack plugins, we are able to deploy a full webpage with its assets bundled together as previously mentioned, and with functioning service workers to cache important files for use offline / to prevent reloading of unnecessary assets.
